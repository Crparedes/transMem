Description: This package facilitates the extraction of useful information
    about transport processes across a membrane. There are several generic
    functions for data transformation (e.g. between instrumental signal and
    transported fraction), non-linear regression using reported empirical 
    equations for process modeling and publication-ready transport profile plots.
