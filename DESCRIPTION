Description: A set of tools for treating and visualizing the results 
    from different experiments involving (selective) transport across membranes. 
    Transport profiles involving up to three species can be easily obtained 
    as publication-ready plots, several membrane performance parameters can be 
    calculated and many experimental results can be easily studied through the 
    package's graphical representations. The package automatizes 
    many recurring data-treatment tasks allowing the experimenter to focus 
    on the more important issues of the research.
