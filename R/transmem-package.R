#' transmem: General tools to manipulate and visualize membrane processes data.
#'
#' This package provides tools for treating and visualizing the results
#' from different experiments involving (selective) transport across membranes.
#' Transport profiles involving up to three species can be easily obtained
#' as publication-ready plots, several membrane performance parameters can be
#' calculated and many experimental results can be easily studied through the
#' package's graphical representations. The package allows the automatization
#' of many routinary data-treatment tasks allowing the experimenter to focus
#' on the more important issues of the research.
