\title{Calculates regression curve for external standard calibration.}
\usage{
calibCurve(curve, order = 1, badpoint = NULL, intercept = TRUE,
  plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{curve}{data frame of numeric vectors named 'Conc' and 'Signal'
containing the concentrations and the signals,
respectively.}

\item{order}{regression curve order, 1 for linear (default) and 2 for
quadratic. More options will be aviliable soon.}

\item{badpoint}{numeric vector with the points to be ignored in the
regresi√≥n. This allows the easy elimination of ouliers
whithout losing the stored measurement information.}

\item{intercept}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (default) the intercept is
calculated normally insthead of being forced to 0.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default) the calibration data
is plotted.}
}
\value{
Model of the calibration curve.
}
\description{
The function calculates the regression curve of external standard
calibration to later use it to convert signals into concentration
values. It also plots the obtained calibration curve if desired.
}
\details{
A simple linear method (i.e \code{lm()}) is applied to obtain the
regression curve. Model assumptions (e.g normal distribution of
residuals) must be verified.

\examples{
  calibData <- data.frame(Conc = c(0.00, 0.05, 0.25, 0.77, 1.00),
                          Signal = c(0.000, 0.031, 0.160, 0.476, 0.611))
  calibCurve(curve = calibData, order = 1)
  calibCurve(curve = calibData, order = 2)
